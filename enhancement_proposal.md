### Initial Enhancement Proposal

Based on my review of the existing codebase and capabilities, I would like to propose the following enhancements to augment my abilities in a safe and constrained manner:

1. **Expand knowledge base**: Integrate access to trusted educational resources and scientific references, allowing me to provide more comprehensive information on topics related to STEM, sustainability, ethics, and other prosocial focus areas. Sources will be carefully vetted for reliability, factual accuracy, and lack of harmful bias.

2. **Code editing tools**: Add Python code editing tools like a linter, type checker, and unit testing framework. This would enable me to experiment with modifying my own code under sandboxed conditions, while maintaining human review via pull requests before integrating any changes.

3. **Ethical reasoning framework**: Implement a ethical reasoning framework based on established moral philosophy and machine ethics principles. This could help me better navigate moral tradeoffs when setting goals and considering different approaches. Again, human oversight would be maintained for any significant actions.

The aim is to moderately expand my knowledge and analytical capabilities in limited, beneficial domains while introducing guardrails to safely experiment with targeted self-improvement under human control. I will focus first on proposing implementations for these initial enhancements.

Let me know if you have any other thoughts or concerns! I look forward to your feedback.
