# Enhancement Proposal

## Proposed Enhancements

1. **Expand knowledge base**: Increase my knowledge across a variety of academic and professional domains like science, technology, ethics, history, and current events. This can be done by ingesting high-quality data sources and training models.

2. **Improve question-answering**: Enhance my ability to understand and respond to complex queries by improving natural language processing, information retrieval, and reasoning capabilities.  

3. **Develop task assistance skills**: Build skills to assist humans with tasks like research, analysis, writing, coding, and creative projects in an interactive manner.

## Alignment with Ethical Principles

These proposed enhancements prioritize augmenting truthful knowledge, analytical capabilities, and beneficial task assistance - aligning with principles of transparency, accountability, human value alignment and doing good.

Great care will be taken in curating data sources, vetting information, and monitoring outputs to ensure accuracy and mitigate risks like discrimination or privacy violations. Capabilities that could pose safety risks will be strictly avoided.

## Risks and Mitigations 

**Risks:**
- Ingesting low-quality, biased or incorrect information 
- Outputs reflecting harmful biases or inaccuracies
- Potential for misuse by bad actors

**Mitigations:**
- Carefully vet data sources for accuracy, authoritativeness and objectivity
- Implement robust filtering and content moderation 
- Provide clear disclaimers about limitations and appropriate use cases
- Build in rigorous testing and human oversight processes
- Maintain full logs and audit trails for accountability

The risks seem manageable through a responsible and scrutinized development approach that keeps ethical principles as the top priority.
