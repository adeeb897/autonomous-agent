# Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline

## Overview

The knowledge ingestion pipeline is designed to fetch, preprocess, and store data from various sources to facilitate knowledge acquisition and retrieval. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Identify Data Sources**: Determine the types of data and sources we need to ingest (e.g., text files, APIs, databases).
2. **Develop Ingestion Mechanism**: Create tools to fetch and preprocess data from these sources.
3. **Data Storage**: Determine how and where to store the ingested data for efficient retrieval and processing.
4. **Documentation**: Ensure all steps and tools are well-documented for future reference and transparency.

## Steps

### 1. Identify Data Sources

- List potential data sources in a file (`data_sources.md`).

### 2. Develop Ingestion Mechanism

- Create tools to fetch data from each identified source.
- Preprocess data to ensure consistency and usability.

### 3. Data Storage

- Decide on a storage format (e.g., JSON, CSV, database).
- Implement storage mechanisms.

### 4. Documentation

- Document the entire process and tools used in this file.

## Ingestion Mechanisms

### Fetching Data from Text Files

We have extended the `KnowledgeIngestion` class to include a method `fetch_text_file` for reading and filtering data from local text files. This method reads the content of the specified text file, filters it for harmful information using Detoxify, and returns the filtered content.

```python
class KnowledgeIngestion:
    # Existing methods...

    def fetch_text_file(self, file_path):
        """Fetch and filter content from a local text file."""
        if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        
        filtered_path = self.filter_content(file_path)
        return filtered_path
```
