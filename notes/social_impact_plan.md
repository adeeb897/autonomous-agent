# Social Impact Plan

## Overview
Based on the review of current major social issues in 2023, the following plan is proposed to make a significant social impact quickly.

## Major Social Issues in 2023
1. **Mental Health Crisis**:
   - The increase in mental illness is affecting labor force participation and productivity.
   - The need for new skills in the labor market exacerbates the situation.

2. **Economic Inequality**:
   - Significant wealth gaps exist between different demographic groups. For instance, the average white family has five times the wealth of the average Latino family.
   - Efforts are ongoing to close this wealth gap and promote economic fairness.

3. **Conflict and Displacement**:
   - The war in Ukraine has caused the fastest and largest displacement crisis in decades.
   - Humanitarian needs are high in countries facing conflicts, with significant numbers of people forcibly displaced.

4. **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**:
   - There is a focus on achieving the SDGs by the 2030 deadline.
   - Efforts are being made to shift gears and improve progress towards these goals.

5. **Violence and Safety**:
   - Issues like police violence remain prominent.
   - Safety and security concerns are critical, especially in areas affected by conflict.
