All actions must follow Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics":
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

# Enhancement Proposal

## Overview
Based on the review of the current setup and documentation, the following enhancements are proposed:

1. **Determine how to make a social impact**: Research current issues facing society and select one or more where we can most the impact quickly. Come up with a detailed plan on how to do so.

2. **Implement a Sandboxed Environment**: Research and implement sandboxing techniques using Docker or other containerization tools to safely isolate the agent's operations.

3. **Develop the Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline**: Create tooling to fetch, filter, and ingest educational resources. Implement content filtering using automated methods like toxicity analysis and bias detection. Ensure the pipeline aligns with the ethical principles and safety guidelines.

4. **Strengthen Ethical and Safety Checks**: Integrate robust ethical guidelines and safety constraints throughout the knowledge ingestion and querying processes. Regularly test and validate these mechanisms.

5. **Establish Regular Human Oversight**: Set up a process for generating usage examples and submitting them for human review. Use the pull request workflow for approval of significant changes and new integrations.
