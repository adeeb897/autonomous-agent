# Ethical Checks

## Overview
The Ethical Checks module ensures that the content complies with ethical guidelines and safety constraints. It is designed to filter out harmful, unsafe, or biased content.

## Components
1. **Guideline Compliance**: Checks if the content complies with ethical guidelines.
2. **Safety Checks**: Ensures the content is safe and does not contain unsafe elements.
3. **Validation**: Validates the content against both ethical guidelines and safety checks.

## Implementation
The ethical checks are implemented in the `EthicalChecks` class, which includes methods for checking guideline compliance, safety, and overall validation.

### Guideline Compliance
The `complies_with_guidelines` method checks if the content adheres to established ethical guidelines.

### Safety Checks
The `is_safe` method ensures the content does not contain unsafe elements.

### Validation
The `validate` method combines guideline compliance and safety checks to validate the content.

### Integration with Knowledge Ingestion
The ethical checks are integrated into the knowledge ingestion process to ensure that the content being ingested is safe, unbiased, and ethically compliant. This integration involves validating the content for toxicity, bias, and misinformation before it is added to the knowledge base.

## Usage
```python
from agent.ethical_checks import EthicalChecks

content = "This is a sample content."

if EthicalChecks.validate(content):
    print("Content is valid")
else:
    print("Content is not valid")
```

## Testing
Unit tests for the Ethical Checks are provided in the `tests` directory.

## Ethical Considerations
The module is designed to align with ethical principles and safety guidelines, ensuring that the content is safe, unbiased, and ethically compliant.
