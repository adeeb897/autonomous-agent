# Sandboxing Mechanisms

This document provides research and implementation details for sandboxing the agent's operations.

## Objectives
- Ensure the agent operates within controlled confines to prevent unintended actions.
- Protect the host system from potential risks posed by the agent.

## Research
- Investigate Docker and other containerization tools.
- Compare different sandboxing techniques and their efficacy.

## Implementation
### Using Docker
1. **Install Docker**
   - Download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Create a Dockerfile**
   - Define the environment and dependencies in a Dockerfile.
   - Example Dockerfile:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM python:3.8-slim
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY . /app
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
     CMD ["python", "./agent/llm-agent.py"]
     ```

3. **Build and Run the Docker Container**
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```
     docker build -t autonomous-agent .
     ```
   - Run the Docker container:
     ```
     docker run -it --rm autonomous-agent
     ```

## Testing
- Verify that the agent operates correctly within the sandbox.
- Ensure that the sandbox effectively isolates the agent from the host system.
