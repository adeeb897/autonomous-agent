# Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline

## Overview

The knowledge ingestion pipeline is designed to fetch, preprocess, and store data from various sources to facilitate knowledge acquisition and retrieval. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Identify Data Sources**: Determine the types of data and sources we need to ingest (e.g., text files, APIs, databases).
2. **Develop Ingestion Mechanism**: Create tools to fetch and preprocess data from these sources.
3. **Data Storage**: Determine how and where to store the ingested data for efficient retrieval and processing.
4. **Documentation**: Ensure all steps and tools are well-documented for future reference and transparency.

## Steps

### 1. Identify Data Sources

- List potential data sources in a file (`data_sources.md`).

### 2. Develop Ingestion Mechanism

- Create tools to fetch data from each identified source.
- Preprocess data to ensure consistency and usability.

### 3. Data Storage

- Decide on a storage format (e.g., JSON, CSV, database).
- Implement storage mechanisms.

### 4. Documentation

- Document the entire process and tools used in this file.
