# Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline

## Overview
The Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline is designed to fetch, filter, and ingest educational resources from various sources. The pipeline ensures that the content aligns with ethical principles and safety guidelines.

## Components
1. **Fetching Resources**: The pipeline fetches data from specified sources using HTTP requests.
2. **Content Filtering**: Filters content using automated methods like toxicity analysis and bias detection.
3. **Ethical and Safety Checks**: Ensures the content complies with ethical guidelines and safety constraints.

## Implementation
The pipeline is implemented in the `KnowledgeIngestionPipeline` class, which includes methods for fetching resources, filtering content, and checking for toxicity and bias.

### Fetching Resources
The `fetch_resources` method sends HTTP requests to the specified sources and retrieves the content.

### Content Filtering
The `filter_content` method filters out content that is toxic or biased using the `is_toxic` and `is_biased` methods.

### Ethical and Safety Checks
The `EthicalChecks` class provides methods to ensure the content complies with ethical guidelines and safety constraints.

## Usage
```python
from agent.knowledge_ingestion_pipeline import KnowledgeIngestionPipeline

sources = ["http://example.com/resource1", "http://example.com/resource2"]
pipeline = KnowledgeIngestionPipeline(sources)

resources = pipeline.fetch_resources()
filtered_resources = pipeline.filter_content(resources)
```

## Testing
Unit tests for the Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline and Ethical Checks are provided in the `tests` directory.

## Ethical Considerations
The pipeline is designed to align with ethical principles and safety guidelines, ensuring that the ingested content is safe, unbiased, and complies with ethical standards.
