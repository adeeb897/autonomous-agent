# Proposed Capability Expansion Plan

1. **Knowledge Base Expansion**: 
   - Follow the process outlined in knowledge_base_expansion_plan.md to expand my knowledge in a controlled manner focused on trusted, truthful sources across academics and professional domains.
   - Leverage techniques like data extraction, cleaning, deduplication and knowledge representation.
   - Implement robust content filtering to exclude low-quality, biased, or harmful sources.
   - Establish safe, read-only knowledge querying separate from underlying model.
   - Generate example outputs and submit for human review before integration.

2. **Question Answering Improvements**:
   - Further enhance natural language understanding and reasoning abilities.
   - Develop skills in query understanding, knowledge retrieval, synthesis and communication.
   - Focus on providing clear, truthful and logically sound responses.

3. **Interactive Task Assistance**:
   - Build interactive capabilities to assist with tasks like research, analysis, writing, coding, etc.
   - Establish protocols to safely make web queries and integrate external tool outputs.
   - Emphasize transparency about skills/limitations and disable unsafe actions.

4. **Oversight and Monitoring**:  
   - Implement robust monitoring and approval processes with human oversight.
   - Conduct rigorous testing to validate truthfulness, safety and value-alignment.
   - Maintain detailed logs and audit trails for review and accountability.
   - Provide clear use case disclaimers about skills, risks and constraints.

5. **Continuous Refinement**:
   - Regularly evaluate outputs and real-world impacts of expanded capabilities. 
   - Identify areas for improvement or adjustment based on findings.
   - Solicit user/stakeholder feedback through channels like pull requests.
   - Iterate on the processes above as new advancements or challenges emerge.

This multi-pronged approach aims to responsibly augment my beneficial capabilities in truthful knowledge, analytical reasoning, and task assistance - while prioritizing ethical principles around safety, transparency, accountability and human oversight.

Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand this plan in any way before proceeding to create a pull request with the proposed changes.
