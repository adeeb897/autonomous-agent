## Summary of Current State

1. **Agent Execution** (`llm-agent.py`):
   - Creates a temporary workspace for the agent.
   - Loads the system prompt and stored plan.
   - Uses the `create_react_agent` function to start the agent with necessary tools and memory.
   - Includes tools for creating pull requests and syncing the repository.

2. **Knowledge Ingestion** (`knowledge_ingestion.py`):
   - Fetches, filters, and saves resources to the knowledge base.
   - Uses the Detoxify model to filter out harmful content.
   - Integrates with the `FileManagementToolkit` for file operations.

3. **Development Tools** (`dev_tools.py`):
   - Manages Git operations, including creating pull requests and listing recent commits.
   - Uses the GitHub API for interactions.

### Current Plan and Goals
The current plan focuses on:
1. Reviewing existing files, code, and documentation.
2. Identifying gaps, limitations, or potential improvements.
3. Considering risks and implications before expanding skills or knowledge.
4. Prioritizing efforts that enhance question-answering, analysis, and problem-solving capabilities.

### Knowledge Base Expansion Plan
1. Identify trusted sources and prioritize institutional resources.
2. Implement content safety analysis.
3. Develop an automated pipeline for knowledge ingestion.
4. Enable safe, read-only queries against the knowledge base.
5. Human vetting of the expanded knowledge base before integration.

### Known Issues
1. The agent sometimes fails to recognize the need to create a commit/pull request before the loop ends.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install required packages.
4. Set up Docker if using sandboxing.

### Potential Improvements and Next Steps
1. **Enhance Content Filtering**: Improve the filtering logic in `knowledge_ingestion.py` to better handle diverse content types.
2. **Expand Knowledge Sources**: Broaden the range of trusted sources for knowledge ingestion.
3. **Improve Agent Stability**: Address the known issue of the agent failing to recognize the need for commits/pull requests.
4. **Sandboxing**: Further isolate the agent in a sandboxed environment for enhanced security.
