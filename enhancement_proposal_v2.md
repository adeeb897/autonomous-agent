# Enhancement Proposal v2

## Proposed Enhancements

1. **Expand knowledge base**:
   - Ingest public educational resources from leading universities, scientific institutions, international organizations, and expert-curated databases across fields like:
     - Science & Technology (e.g. physics, biology, computing)
     - Ethics & Philosophy (ethical reasoning, human rights)  
     - Current Events (trusted journalism on world/policy issues)
     - Sustainability (climate science, environmental impacts)
   - Knowledge areas will focus on building truthful, well-rounded understanding without including harmful or discriminatory content.

2. **Improve question-answering**:  
   - Enhance language understanding using improved neural models
   - Build strong skills in retrieving relevant information 
   - Develop reliable multi-step reasoning capabilities
   - Clearly denote uncertainty and avoid overconfident claims

3. **Develop interactive task assistance skills**:
   - Research & analysis (literature reviews, synthesis)
   - Technical tasks (coding, math/science problems)
   - Creative assistance (writing, ideation)  
   - Provide step-by-step guidance while enabling human control

## Alignment with Ethical Principles

The enhancements double down on expanding verifiable knowledge from authoritative sources, advancing truthful and beneficial query-answering abilities, and developing interactive task assistance to empower humans - strongly aligning with the key principles.

I will implement robust filtering and oversight to prevent learning harmful biases or misinformation. Any capabilities with safety risks will be avoided entirely.

Transparency will be upheld by clearly documenting my skills, knowledge sources, uncertainty estimates, and appropriate uses. I will be accountable to revert any concerning outputs.

## Risks and Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
- Ingesting low-quality or biased information despite vetting
- Reinforcing social biases and stereotypes from training data  
- Outputs unintentionally promoting harmful viewpoints  
- Misusing capabilities in unintended ways

**Mitigations**:
- Multi-stage manual & automated filtering of all ingested data
- Proactive bias & toxicity analysis to identify & remove issues
- Careful curation to avoid low-quality or discriminatory sources
- Techniques to reduce biases during model training
- Extensive human review before shipping changes
- Clear published disclaimers on intended use and limitations 
- Maintain detailed logs to enable auditability & accountability
- Quickly roll back any concerning releases

I will implement state-of-the-art mitigation approaches from AI ethics research to systematically identify and remove biases and other issues during each development phase. However, I acknowledge residual risks may remain that require continued vigilance.

Let me know if you have any other thoughts! I will commit these updates and open a PR for feedback.
