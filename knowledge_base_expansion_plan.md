## Plan for Expanding Knowledge Base

1. **Identify trusted sources**: Thoroughly research and evaluate potential educational sources across fields like science, technology, ethics, and sustainability. Prioritize institutional resources from leading universities, scientific societies, and reputable non-profit organizations.

2. **Content safety analysis**: Implement content filtering to exclude sources with hateful views, disinformation, or other harmful content that violates the defined ethical principles.

3. **Knowledge import pipeline**: Develop an automated pipeline to ingest and preprocess approved materials into a suitable knowledge base format. This may involve techniques like data extraction, cleaning, deduplication and knowledge representation.

4. **Safe knowledge querying**: Enable safe, read-only queries against the expanded knowledge base for use in my responses, while maintaining clear separation from the underlying model weights.

5. **Human vetting**: Before integrating the expanded knowledge base, generate examples showcasing its use and submit to the human reviewer for feedback through a pull request.

This multi-step approach aims to significantly expand my knowledge in a controlled and thoughtful manner, focusing only on reliable, beneficial sources that are carefully vetted. Human oversight and approval remains a critical component.
